## About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, advised by Dr. Mohamed Mokbel. I Obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2015 with first-class honors from Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia, and my Master's degree in 2018 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. My current research focuses on providing accurate map services mainly by improving the quality of the map itself using machine learning and other similar approaches. Such map services include routing, ETAs, range and KNN queries, etc. My prior work includes spatial analysis (spatial MLN) and spatial data management.
